"*IMPORTANT* Blue-green algae, Lyngbya (Cyanophyta)","The Lake Almanor Watershed Group conducted their investigations in the eastern and western basins of Lake Almanor on August 5, 2025. I collected plankton samples and have examined them. I found significant numbers of a genus of blue-green algae, Lyngbya (Cyanophyta). Some species of this alga are known to produce toxins, but I don’t know if this species does. However, it is always a good idea to remind folks to rinse off their children and pets after letting them swim and to not let them drink water from the lake in large amounts.

If you have any further questions, I'm happy to answer them. LAWG appreciates the support that LACC has provided for our water quality work.
