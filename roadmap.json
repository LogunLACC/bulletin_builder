Every commit must reference the relevant roadmap task. Reject or defer any work that is not directly tied to a roadmap item. Regularly review completed tasks and update their status; do not mark tasks complete without verification. Prevent scope creep by strictly enforcing roadmap boundaries and requiring explicit approval for any expansion."
